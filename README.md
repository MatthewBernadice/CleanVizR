# CleanVizR

CleanVizR is a beginner-friendly R package designed to simplify data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It provides a set of helper functions for handling missing values, standardizing column names, generating quick visualizations, cleaning text data, and creating correlation heatmaps. The package leverages popular R packages like ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, tibble, RColorBrewer, qdap, and forecast to deliver consistent, easy-to-use tools that help analysts quickly explore and prepare datasets for analysis.

The package comes preloaded with R’s native datasets, such as mtcars, iris, airquality, ToothGrowth, and PlantGrowth, allowing users to experiment and test functions immediately. For example, users can quickly impute missing values in airquality using clean_missing(), generate a histogram of mpg in mtcars using quick_hist(), or create a correlation heatmap for numeric columns in any dataset with corr_heatmap_clean(). These functions are ideal for learning best practices in EDA, preparing datasets for modeling, or creating quick visual summaries for reports and presentations.

While CleanVizR significantly lowers the barrier to cleaning and visualizing data, there are areas for improvement in future versions. Currently, categorical variable handling, advanced visualization customization, robust error handling for edge cases, and more comprehensive text preprocessing (like stemming or tokenization) are not fully implemented. Beginners may also need additional guidance on handling non-standard data types, understanding package dependencies, or integrating multiple cleaning steps into a workflow.

Future updates will aim to address these gaps by adding functions for categorical data imputation, enhanced plotting options, workflow summaries, and interactive visualizations. The package could also include automated EDA reports that combine data cleaning and visualization outputs, making it even easier for beginners and analysts alike to explore, clean, and present datasets efficiently. Overall, CleanVizR offers a solid foundation for practical data cleaning and visualization, with room to expand into a full beginner-oriented EDA toolkit.
